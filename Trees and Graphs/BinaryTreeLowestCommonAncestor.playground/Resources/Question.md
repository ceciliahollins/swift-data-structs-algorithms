# Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Source: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/description/)

## Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Here's a sample binary tree node class:
```swift
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     public var val: Int
 *     public var left: TreeNode?
 *     public var right: TreeNode?
 *     public init(_ val: Int) {
 *         self.val = val
 *         self.left = nil
 *         self.right = nil
 *     }
 * }
```

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
* -109 <= Node.val <= 109
* All Node.val are unique.
* p != q
* p and q will exist in the tree.
