# swift-data-structs-algorithms
*WIP* A project to demonstrate data structs and algorithm problem solving in swift

## Description

This repository showcases data structure and algorithm problems completed independently by the author. 

Every problem has a .md file for the question, a swift file for the solution, a swift file with unit tests, and a .md file containing a discussion. The disucssion file will showcase the recommended solution at the top of the file based on time and space complexity, as well as other potential solution. All possible solutions have an explanation of how the algorithm works, as well as an analysis on the time and space complexity.

## Sources

All problems are taken from the sources below:
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
[InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com/)

Problems currently in WIP may have solutions, but have no discussion and solution may potentially be outdated. The author plans on completing these in the near future.
