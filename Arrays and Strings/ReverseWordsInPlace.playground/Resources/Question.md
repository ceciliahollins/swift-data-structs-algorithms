# Reverse Words in Place

## You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have handed off the last step to you.

Write a function reverseWords() that takes a message as an array of characters and reverses the order of the words in place.

For example:
```swift
var message = Array("cake pound steal");

reverseWords(&message)

print(String(message))
// prints: "steal pound cake"
```

When writing your function, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, and all words are separated by one space.
